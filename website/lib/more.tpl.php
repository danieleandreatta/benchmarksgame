<li>Each program was run and measured at the smallest input value, program output redirected to a file and compared to expected output. As long as the output matched expected output, the program was then run and measured at the next larger input value until measurements had been made at every input value.</li>

<li>If the program gave the expected output within an arbitrary cutoff time (120 seconds) the program was measured again (5 more times) with output redirected to /dev/null.</li>

<li>If the program didn't give the expected output within an arbitrary timeout (usually one hour) the program was forced to quit. If measurements at a smaller input value had been successful within an arbitrary cutoff time (120 seconds), the program was measured again (5 more times) at that smaller input value, with output redirected to /dev/null.</li>

<li>The measurements shown on the website are either
<ul><li>within the arbitrary cutoff - the lowest time and highest memory use from 6 measurements</li>
<li>outside the arbitrary cutoff - the sole time and memory use measurement</li></ul></li>

<li>For sure, programs taking 4 and 5 hours were only measured once!</li>

<dt><a href="#java" name="java">What about Java&#174; VM warm-up?</a></dt>
<dd><p>Let's see how much, or how little, the time taken to invoke the JVM might contribute to the usual Java program times shown in the benchmarks game. Here are some <b>additional</b> (Intel&#174; Q6600&#174; quad-core) elapsed time measurements, taken after the Java programs started and before they exited.</p> 

<p>In the first case (Cold), we simply started and measured the program 66 times; and then discarded the first measurement leaving 65 data points.</p>

<pre>
   public static void main(String[] args){
      for (int i=0; i&lt;1; ++i){ 
         System.gc(); 
         long t1 = System.nanoTime();
         nbody.program_main(args);
         long t2 = System.nanoTime();
         System.err.println( String.format( "%.6f", (t2 - t1) * 1e-9 ) );         
      }
   }
</pre>

<p>In the second case (Warmed), we started the program once and repeated measurements again and again and again 66 times without restarting the JVM; and then discarded the first measurement leaving 65 data points.</p>

<pre>
   public static void main(String[] args){
      for (int i=0; i&lt;66; ++i){ 
         System.gc(); 
         long t1 = System.nanoTime();
         nbody.program_main(args);
         long t2 = System.nanoTime();
         System.err.println( String.format( "%.6f", (t2 - t1) * 1e-9 ) );         
      }
   }
</pre>

<dt><a href="#inputvalue" name="inputvalue">What does N mean?</a></dt>
<dd><p>N means the value passed to the program on the command-line (or the value used to create the data file passed to the program on stdin). Larger N causes the program to do more work - mostly measurements are shown for the largest N, the largest workload.</p>

<dt><a href="#cpuloadpercent" name="cpuloadpercent">What does '27% 34% 28% 67%' &asymp; CPU Load mean?</a></dt>
<dd><p>When the program was being measured: the first core was not-idle about 27% of the time, the second core was not-idle about 34% of the time, the third core was not-idle about 28% of the time, the fourth core was not-idle about 67% of the time.</p>
<p>When <em>all the programs</em> show &asymp; CPU Load like this '0% 0% 0% 100%' you are probably looking at measurements of programs forced to use just one core - the fourth core (rather than being allowed to use any or all of the CPU cores).</p>
